2
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:11,826
For thousands of years, religious Jews
have praticed the ritual of "the vigil"-

3
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:16,122
When a member of the
community dies, the body is

4
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,666
watched round-the-clock
in shofts by a Shomer, or

5
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,210
watchamn, who recites the
Psalms to comfort the

6
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,796
deceased's soul and protect
it from unseen evil.

7
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,887
This watchman is typically a family member
or friend, but there are paid Shomers...

8
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:38,978
Hired to sit the vigil
when no one else can.

9
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:15,175
Stop acting crazy!

10
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:17,720
I wish that'd happen to me.

11
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:38,365
You know what I mean?

12
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,887
An old, fat Goy with terrible teeth?

13
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:02,306
An old, fat Goy with terrible teeth?
- Drunk on the street.

14
00:06:57,797 --> 00:07:00,216
Oh, great...

15
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,996
I want to talk to him for just a minute.

16
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,418
I only want to ask him something.

17
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:15,517
How are you?

18
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:17,561
You look a little exhausted...

19
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:19,438
You look a little exhausted...
- I'm good.

20
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:22,774
How are things going
with this new lifestyle?

21
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:29,198
Listen, I didn't...

22
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:32,368
I didn't want to push you away or anything.

23
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:36,122
I'm not trying to pry or get
into your business either.

24
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:39,125
It's just that I think about you
all the time. You understand?

25
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,710
You said you had a question.

26
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:46,465
I need you to be a Shomer. Tonight.

27
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:49,010
I will pay you.

28
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:57,351
I know you could use the money.

29
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:59,853
And I know you have trouble with rent...

30
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,481
And I know you have trouble with rent...
- How do you know that?

31
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:04,150
How do you know that?

32
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,403
Why's it matter? I'll give
you $200 dollars, cash.

33
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:08,946
Right now.

34
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:10,781
For how long?

35
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,408
For how long?
Five hours.

36
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,701
From now until the morning.

37
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,164
We had someone.

38
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:22,543
But he changed his mind and left suddenly.

39
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:30,342
$300.

40
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:32,344
You came to me?

41
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:33,429
Right?

42
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:34,513
Right?
Yeah.

43
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:36,223
You're desperate, right? You need me.

44
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:37,308
Right?

45
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:39,685
Ok. So $500.

46
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:44,440
I used to do this all the time.

47
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:56,493
I'll give you $400. Not a dollar more.

48
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:20,142
I knew right away you'd take this job.

49
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:27,899
And I know you're doing it for the money
but it's nothing to be ashamed of.

50
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:31,862
I honestly wanted to ask
you because sitting the

51
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:35,532
vigil, it brings you
closer to the community.

52
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,452
Wow. This is...

53
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:41,288
It is truly God's plan.

54
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:50,922
It's just that when you sit the vigil,
it's holy. It brings you back to us.

55
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:54,801
You've been feeling down.
We can talk things

56
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,388
through. Maybe tonight
will even help a bit...

57
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,976
So Shulem, who is the deceased?

58
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:06,397
He's Rubin Litvak, did you know him?

59
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,149
He's Rubin Litvak, did you know him?
- No.

60
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:10,442
He was a good man, a little weird.

61
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:13,279
He was a Holocaust survivor
who made it through

62
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,697
the war but lost his
entire family there.

63
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:18,867
After the war, he started a family here...

64
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,039
But then he became a recluse,
estranged from his kids and grandchildren.

65
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:26,625
He hadn't left his home in years.
It's a really sad story.

66
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,087
He used to say that
whenever he stepped out of

67
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:33,090
his house, it was like he
was in absolute agony.

68
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,343
The other Shomer just ran out.
I trusted him, he's

69
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,929
family, but he left the job
because he was afraid...

70
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:40,013
Afraid?

71
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:41,265
Afraid?
That's what he said.

72
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,975
Why was he afraid?

73
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:54,361
Mr. Litvak's wife suffers from
Alzheimer's and is quite frail.

74
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:58,407
She'll likely sleep through the night.

75
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:03,412
It'll be quiet.

76
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:08,584
Here we are.

77
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:13,190
He will be the Shomer tonight.

78
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,361
He's an experienced Shomer. He sat the
vigil for Moshe Kellner, Chaim Sturman...

79
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:27,371
I know that you had a very
difficult and upsetting day.

80
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,332
But this will be good, it'll be good...

81
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,811
She'll sleep, don't worry about it.

82
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:38,900
The mortuary guys will be here at dawn.

83
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:09,139
The mortuary men will be here in...

84
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,725
...five hours.

85
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,103
If you have any problems, my house...

86
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:18,649
I'm saying that if there is
a problem, I'm close by.

87
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,192
It'd be nice if you'd join
us for the morning prayers.

88
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:29,410
Look I'm not trying to push you.
All I'm saying is

89
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:32,203
that it might be difficult
being here all night and...

90
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,706
...if you want to chat about
it later, come to synagogue.

91
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,420
Okay. No problem. I hope
everything goes well.

92
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:50,055
See ya later.

Mazzik July 271979

101
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:23,776
You told me Lieb could do magic.

102
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:25,486
He couldn't do anything!

103
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,698
He couldn't do anything!
- I never said he could really do magic!

104
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:30,075
Yes, you did!

105
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,785

Sarah Hi

109
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:39,412
Hey.

110
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:54,885
New message from Sarah

111
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:30,505
Sarah What're you doing?

112
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:40,723
Working. I'm Shomer for the night.

113
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:53,569
I should not be on my phone.

114
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:58,283
Sarah
Ok. Sorry :(

115
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:18,553
No. It's ok.

116
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:34,444
What are you...

117
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,364
Sarah It's a pretty night.

118
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:42,077
The moon is out.
You ever see the rabbit in it?

119
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:45,913
Rabbit?

120
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:53,379
Sarah The nose is facing up,

121
00:29:53,504 --> 00:29:55,881
little tail at the bottom.

122
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:58,134
It's silly.
I should let you go.

123
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:36,964
Not silly.

124
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:43,804
Talk soon.

125
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:49,769

128
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:54,161
Pull yourself together.

129
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:06,674
I'm losing my mind.

130
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:19,645
I'm going crazy.

131
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:31,530
I let them hurt you...

132
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:40,664
I couldn't...

133
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:42,917
I couldn't move.

134
00:59:44,043 --> 00:59:46,670

INCOMING FACETIME Sarah

138
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:55,799
You need to go upstairs, Yacov.

139
01:01:56,675 --> 01:02:00,263
There is no point in fighting.

140
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:10,731
You watched Burech scream.

141
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:13,859
Watched him cry for you.

142
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,611
And you didn't move.

143
01:02:15,987 --> 01:02:19,240
You just let him die.

144
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:53,667
I know.

145
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:00,841
I was scared...

146
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:15,648
Please forgive me.

147
01:04:21,445 --> 01:04:24,740
Please forgive me.

148
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:33,916
I was...

149
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,460
I was...

150
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,422
I was scared.

151
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,644
Are you ok?

152
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:31,998
So did you have a good night?

153
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:34,959
Any problems? Anything come up?

154
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,421
Sure?

155
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:39,839
Of course.

156
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:44,844
Well, let me give you what I promised you.

157
01:20:45,052 --> 01:20:46,888
Mrs. Litvak?

158
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:01,528
As I mentioned yesterday,
I truly hoped this

159
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:04,447
experience might give you a
new perspective on life.

160
01:21:04,572 --> 01:21:07,575
I hoped we could talk about it.

161
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:10,412
Come with me to morning prayers.

162
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:12,914
Will you come with me to morning prayers?

163
01:21:21,005 --> 01:21:23,090
I know you mean well.

164
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:28,221
I know this.

165
01:21:58,251 --> 01:22:01,879
Sarah
Ugh, I'm up early. How was your night?

166
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:36,248
Coffee?
